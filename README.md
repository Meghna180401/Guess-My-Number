## Description
This is a very basic JavaScript project I did as a part of a Udemy course - [The Complete JavaScript Course 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). 

In this game the player has to guess a secret number (which is not entirely a secretðŸ¤«). 
But Hold On! There's a penalty for each wrong guess the player makes. However the player can try and do better with each try as there is a tracker of high score.

This project was done to brush up basic JavaScript skills and DOM manipulation.

## Key Learnings
- Brushing Up HTML5,CSS and JavaScript and DOM Manipulation
- Properly exploring Git and GitHub using Command Line Interface
- Working with tools such as Visual Studio Code
- Making code readable and documentation

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank [Prof. Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) for his highly extensive and methodical lectures on JavaScript. I still have a long way to go exploring JavaScript under his guidance.

I would also like to credit [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for guiding me out every little loophole in my code.

Finally, I would like to thank my best friend [Atrik Ray](https://github.com/AtrikGit6174) for being my biggest supporter at all times.
